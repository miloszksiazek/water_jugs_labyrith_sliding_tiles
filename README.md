# Water Jugs Labyrinth and Sliding Tiles Solver üß©
This project explores the classic sliding tile puzzle problem with a unique twist inspired by a jug labyrinth concept. The program is designed to solve puzzles using algorithmic strategies and demonstrates the principles of state exploration and pathfinding in a constrained environment.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Puzzle Solver: Automatically solves sliding tile puzzles using efficient algorithms.
	‚Ä¢	State Exploration: Tracks and visualizes states during the solving process.
	‚Ä¢	Algorithmic Approaches: Implements search algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or A*.
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Notebook: User-friendly Jupyter Notebook for hands-on experimentation.

Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python üêç
	‚Ä¢	NumPy for matrix manipulation
	‚Ä¢	Matplotlib for visualization of puzzle states
	‚Ä¢	Custom algorithms for solving and visualizing puzzle progress
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step execution

How It Works
	1.	Puzzle Initialization: Define the initial and goal states of the sliding tile puzzle.
	2.	State Transitions: Identify legal moves within the labyrinth constraints.
	3.	Pathfinding Algorithm: Solve the puzzle using an appropriate algorithm, tracking the solution path.
	4.	Visualization: Render each state transition for better understanding and debugging.

Usage
	1.	Clone the repository:
 	2.	Open the Jug_labyrinth_sliding_tiles.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
	3.	Follow the step-by-step instructions to define puzzles, solve them, and visualize results.

Future Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Add support for custom labyrinth constraints and larger puzzles.
	‚Ä¢	Optimize algorithms for faster performance on complex puzzles.
	‚Ä¢	Include a web-based interface for puzzle input and solution visualization.
